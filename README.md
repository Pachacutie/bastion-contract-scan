## What It Detects

### RED — High Severity

| Flag | Name | What It Means |
|------|------|---------------|
| R1 | Auto-Renewal | Contract renews for 12+ months automatically if you miss a narrow cancellation window |
| R2 | Short Cancellation Window | Must cancel 30-60+ days before renewal, often via certified mail |
| R3 | ETF = Remaining Balance | Early termination fee is 75-100% of remaining contract value |
| R4 | Liability Cap Under $1,000 | Provider pays at most $250-$1,000 if the system fails during a real event |
| R5 | Forced Arbitration | You cannot sue or join a class action |
| R6 | Data Sharing | Your alarm data and usage patterns shared with third parties |

### YELLOW — Medium Severity

| Flag | Name | What It Means |
|------|------|---------------|
| Y1 | Unilateral Rate Increase | Provider can raise your rate with 30 days notice |
| Y2 | Equipment Lease | You pay for equipment but never own it |
| Y3 | Monitoring Center Change | Your alerts may route to an unknown subcontractor |
| Y4 | Waiver of Subrogation | Your insurer can't go after the security company |
| Y5 | Written Cancel Only | Must send a physical letter — no phone, email, or online |
| Y6 | Installation Damage Waiver | Provider not liable for damage during installation |

### GREEN — Informational

| Flag | Name | What It Extracts |
|------|------|-----------------|
| G1 | Contract Term | Initial term length in months |
| G2 | Monthly Rate | Dollar amount per month |
| G3 | Equipment Ownership | Purchase vs. lease vs. free-with-contract |
| G4 | Permit Responsibility | Who obtains the alarm permit |

## How It Works

Pattern matching against extracted text. No AI, no cloud, no network calls. Your contract never leaves your machine.

Each flag has a set of trigger phrases — keywords and regex patterns drawn from real contract language across the home security industry. When a trigger matches, the scanner extracts the surrounding context as evidence.
